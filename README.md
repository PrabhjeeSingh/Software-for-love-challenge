# Software-for-love-challenge

Hi
I wanted to thank Software for love, It was fun doing the challenge. I learned about new things like gatsby and Netlify

#I knew just javascript basic so Node.js and gatsby was new to me so I watched some tutorial on youtube
and read the official doc


I was done with the basic implementation of the navbar same day but later i added some basic designs

 Just before submitting i noticed that i had to implement navbar in the header but i had used the 
layout.js for implementing it, thats the reason behind having different file for navbar 
Lastly I Have added navbar to header removed from layout

# Now that i think of it, I think its a better approach because its so easier debuggin and manipulating the style + overall look of it

# I didnt used bootstrap because i thought what would be the fun in doing that lol
